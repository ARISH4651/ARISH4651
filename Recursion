A function that calls itself is known as recursion. Recursion is a process by which a function calls itself repeatedly until some specified
condition has been satisfied.
Pseudo code:

Main function:
BEGIN
GET n
CALL fact = factorial(n)
PRINT fact
END
Sub function factorial(n):
IF (n==1) THEN
fact=1
RETURN fact
ELSE
RETURN fact = n*factorial (n-1
